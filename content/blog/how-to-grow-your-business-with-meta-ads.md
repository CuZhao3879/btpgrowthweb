In today's digital landscape, Meta Ads (Facebook and Instagram advertising) remain one of the most powerful tools for business growth. With over 3 billion active users across Meta platforms, the potential reach is unprecedented.

## Why Meta Ads Still Matter

Despite the ever-changing digital marketing landscape, Meta Ads continue to deliver exceptional ROI for businesses of all sizes. Here's why:

- **Precise Targeting**: Reach your exact audience based on demographics, interests, and behaviors
