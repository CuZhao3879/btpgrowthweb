## Reason 1: Credibility and Trust Building

In 2025, not having a website is like not having a business card — it raises questions about legitimacy.

## Reason 2: 24/7 Availability and Accessibility

Your physical store has opening hours, but your website works around the clock.

## Reason 3: Local SEO and Discoverability

When Malaysians search for products or services, they use Google. If you're not online, you're invisible.

## Reason 5: Showcase Your Products and Services

A website is your digital showroom, open to everyone, anytime.
