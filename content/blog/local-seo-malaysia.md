# Local SEO in Malaysia: How to Get More Customers Near You

When someone in Malaysia searches for "restaurant near me," "plumber in KL," or "best clinic in Penang," they're looking for local businesses. If your business isn't showing up in these local search results, you're missing out on valuable customers.

Local SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the practice of optimizing your online presence to attract more customers from relevant local searches. In Malaysia, where mobile usage is high and "near me" searches are common, local SEO is essential for businesses with physical locations or those serving local areas.
